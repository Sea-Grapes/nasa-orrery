# Nasa Orrery (Incomplete)

https://nasa-orrery.vercel.app/

Submission for [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/), but I speedrun it in 1.5hrs (and probably don't finish) cause I had too much hw :( (Im very sad)

Update: unfortunately I did not finish. this is very sad ðŸ˜­

I tried to make an orrery. Unfortunately I dont have time to understand keplarian parameters. Therefore Idk how to do this.
